# **App Name**: Nimbus Navigator

## Core Features:

- Current Weather Display: Display current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather condition icon, based on the user's location.
- Location Search: Implement a search bar to allow users to manually enter a location and fetch weather data. Implement debouncing to limit calls to the weather API.
- Animated Weather Icons: Show an animated icon representing the current weather condition, for example, a sun icon for sunny weather or a rain cloud icon for rainy weather.
- Activity Suggestions: Use a generative AI tool to provide users with suggestions for activities based on the weather conditions. The suggestions can be related to nearby activities.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#74B9FF) to evoke a sense of calm and clear skies.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8), providing a neutral backdrop for the weather information.
- Accent color: Warm orange (#FFAC33) to highlight interactive elements and call attention to important information.
- Use a clean, modern, sans-serif font for all text elements to ensure readability and a sleek aesthetic.
- Employ a set of consistent and visually appealing weather icons. These icons will intuitively represent the current weather conditions, such as sunny, cloudy, rainy, or snowy. 
- Adopt a minimalist layout that ensures easy navigation. The most crucial weather information should be immediately visible without requiring the user to scroll or search.
- Implement subtle animations for changes in weather conditions or data updates, giving the interface a dynamic feel. Add a parallax effect to the background when scrolling.
